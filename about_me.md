## First time introductions:
Hi! I'm a second year engineering undergraduate at the University of Cambridge, and I like to dabble in various things, but I take a keen interest in the intersection between AI, aviation, and automation.

## If you asked me about my background...
My response would ionvolve three countries, over a dozen homes, and you might probably still conclude, for simplicity's sake, that I am a Singaporean.

What I can say, however, is that my diverse experiences shaped my thinking growing up. I value holistic, global, big-picture thinking; I am curious in bridging cultural and geographical divides between engineering solutions. I remember coming back to Singapore and observing how technology such as reverse osmosis has been adapted to local needs, how aviation navigation has been revolutionised in the U.S. with ADS-B, and how design, product, and solutions often have to be adapted to meet local needs: glocalisation, in Geographers' jargon.

More importantly, I am convinced of the neccessity and importance of being able to draw connections in approaching a topic or problem, technical or otherwise.

## Always Curious
As a result of this, I have always been the one to try new things. Be it representing France in our school's first ever MUN delegation, taking part in hackathons and spearheading projects, or taking the time to work towards my PPL; these pursuits taught me the importance of 'soft' skills, being able to think broadly, but act with precision.

Intentionally seeking out work experience in different industries during my free time has also served to broaden my understanding of the technology and processes that we leverage across a broad spectrum of operations.

## Empathy and Co-operation
During my time in NS, I quickly realised that taking the time to communicate intent, and working with people to build their skills and character, was much more effective than demanding work from them. Volunteering to work with refugees in Eastern Europe was an incredible experience, one that showed me how humans react when we are pushed to our psychological and physical limits.

I enjoy working in teams, bouncing ideas off others, facilitating discussion, and moderating responsibilites; though I often produce my best work in the mid-mornings or mid-afternoons, when I have had some time alone to reflect and consolidate my thoughts.

## Outside of School
I took up rowing in first year of university, and learnt some Japanese on the side, though I thoroughly enjoy playing badminton and football (soccer). Occasionally I take photographs (in the near future I will have a homemade drone for said photography!) I also volunteer with a local church, looking after vulnerable children on a weekly basis.

I'm always happy to talk about planes, badminton, or my faith, and if any of what I've said piques your interest, I'd gladly carry on the conversation over [email](lyndon@live.com.sg)!
