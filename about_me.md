## If you asked me what my background was
My response would involve three countries, over a dozen homes, and you might probably still conclude, for simplicity's sake, that I am a Singaporean.

What I do know, however, is that my diverse experiences shaped my thinking growing up. I value holistic, global, big-picture thinking; I am curious in bridging cultural and geographical divides between engineering solutions. I remember coming back to Singapore and observing how technology such as reverse osmosis has been adapted to local needs, how aviation navigation has been revolutionised in the U.S. with ADS-B, and how designs, products, and solutions often have to be adapted to meet local needs: glocalisation, in Geographers' jargon.

As a result of this, I am always keen to try new things. My experience working in different industries during my free time, exploring and working on projects, taking part in hackathons, have all served to broaden my understanding of the technology and processes that we use as leverage for our progress.

## I am a firm believer in empathy, working with, and not for people.
During my time in NS, I quickly realised that taking the time to communicate intent, and working with people to build their skills and character, was much more effective than demanding work from them. Volunteering to work with refugees in Eastern Europe was an incredible experience, one that showed me how humans react when we are pushed to our psychological and physical limits.
