# Hello There!

Welcome to my page! Here, I explain a little bit more about who I am and what I do. It's a home for words that don't belong on a CV, thoughts that aren't mainstream enough to be blogged about, and a scrapbook of ideas which may never work, but would never hurt to try.

Here, you can find links to [my CV](/files/Lyndon Teng-CV8.6-O.pdf), find out more about me, what I get up to at uni, or what I ponder in my free time (is that even a thing?). This site will always be a work-in-progress; I hope you enjoy it!
